# fibonacci
Fibonacci: 1 source code file(s) are part of this submission:

    -> Fibonacci.java

To compile the lab, execute:

$ javac Fibonacci.java

To run the lab, execute:

$ java Fibonacci <start number> <number of desired calculations>

or 

$ java Fibonacci <start number>

or

$ java Fibonacci

This program computes the Fibonacci sequence recursively and efficiently.
It is able to calculate the fibonacci sequence of a large number for a large number
of calculations. As the number calculated gets bigger than 10 digits long, the
output is in the following format:
 
    -> "first three digits(number of digits in between)last four digits"

The output is in a text file called TIMING that shows the average time taken to 
compute the Fibonacci number.
